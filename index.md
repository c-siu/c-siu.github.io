## Personal

I am from Hong Kong. I would be really happy if you greet me with "zou sun" and "ng on" (Good morning and Good afternoon in Cantonese).

My favorite author is Dostoyevsky; favorite TV show, Taskmaster. Need to balance the heaviness and the lightness.

I am mostly an indoor guy, but Ithaca has made me more active. Picked up hiking and ice-skating here. Try to catch me at a trail or in the rink.
